# ChatGPT-Chatbot
### Hello and welcome to my first project completion on github! 
###  
###  
This is a simple python program that uses the ChatGPT API to provide the user with answers to specific questions in a google home-like manner!
#
I created and ran this program with a raspberry pi 4 in a virtual environment using vim along with a PnP Microphone for user input and a USB Speaker for output.
